fastapi: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It uses ASGI for high performance and supports automatic API documentation generation.

uvicorn: An ASGI web server implementation for Python, used to run FastAPI applications. It provides high-performance async capabilities and is commonly used as the server for FastAPI apps.

streamlit: An open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects. It turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, with no front-end experience required.

requests: A simple, yet elegant HTTP library for Python. It allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily, handling JSON, authentication, and more.

python-multipart: A streaming multipart parser for Python, useful for handling file uploads and form data in web applications, particularly with FastAPI.
